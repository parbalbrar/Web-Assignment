  <p style="font-size:2vw;">Responsive design is a visual user interface (GUI) design strategy for creating content that adapts to different screen sizes without losing its quality. Designers use relative units (percentages) and media queries to ensure that their designs adjust to the browser space and maintain content uniformity across devices. Mainly responsive web design is one approach to the problem of designing for the multitude of devices available to customers, ranging from tiny phones to huge desktop monitors. RWD uses so-called breakpoints to determine how the layout of a site will appear: one design is used above a breakpoint and another design is applied below that breakpoint. The breakpoints are commonly based on the width of the browser. The same HTML is served to all devices, with the appearance of the page changed using CSS which affects the layout of the page. Instead of designing separate sites and codebases for wide-screen displays, desktops, laptops, tablets, and phones of all sizes, a single codebase can accommodate users with varying viewport widths.
    Responsive design can assist you in resolving a variety of issues with your website. It will make your site mobile-friendly, improve its appearance on devices with both large and small displays, and boost the amount of time visitors spend on it. It can also assist you in improving your search engine rankings. In today's world, we live in a multi-screen society. As a result, it's critical that your website be viewable on as many devices as possible, because you never know what device someone will use to access it. According to responsive website statistics, it's a good idea to appeal to both desktop and mobile users. Mobile viewers currently exceed desktop watchers, and this trend is expected to continue as worldwide smartphone accessibility improves.<br>
